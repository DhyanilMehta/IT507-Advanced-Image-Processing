# IT507-Advanced-Image-Processing

This repository contains the image processing tasks and techniques applied and used during the course IT507 Advanced Image Processing in M.Tech at DAIICT, Gandhinagar.

The notebooks contains image processing techniques like histogram equalization, histogram specification, template matching, applying different type of filters using convolution, image sharpening, image smoothing, bit plane slicing, etc.

## Assignment 1
- Quantization and it's effects
- Effect of guassian noise
- Number of connected components

## Assignment 2
- Mask to remove larger object in image
- Detecting motion between 2 image
- Template matching(finding part of image in larger image)

## Assignment 3
- Bit plane slicing
- Histogram equilisation/matching (make similar histogram of 1 image as another image) : This will apply same filter on 1 image by looking onto another image
- Dehasing of image

## Assignment 4
- Averaging and weighted average filter 
- convolution (apply mask/filter on image)
- Unsharp masking and High boost filtering
- Make skelton image more effect to analyse 
    Filter applied
    - Laplacian filter
    - Gamma transformation
    - vertical & horizontal sobel gradient
